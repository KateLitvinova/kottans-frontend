## 0. Git basics

The information about VCS was totally new for me. But i learned a lot of things and now i understand how GIT works.

## 1. Linux CLI, and HTTP

### Linux Survival
I have no experience with Linux system. But information was pretty clear and interesting.

### HTTP articles 
The articles about HTTP are very informative and needs to be read thoughtfully and several times. I will return to them later for a more detailed understanding and this information will become more clear during my further work.

## Git Collaboration

More useful information and more understanding how to cooperate with the teams using Git and GitHub. I don't use PR on daily basis (yet:), so the information was new and interesting to me.
